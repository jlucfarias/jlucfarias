## Welcome!

Hi, my name is João Lucas Farias, brazilian, and I'm a systems analyst that actuate more commonly as a full stack developer.
I'm quite analytical and organized, but always open for changes. The best place to me is where I can learn with my fellows and teach if necessary.
I'm always open to help everyone even if I know nothing about the problem because looking for solutions is more or less easy for me.
Reach me at LinkedIn (link above) and send me a DM.
